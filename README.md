# UnrealMapPop
Populating UE Maps with Static Meshes for display.
Intended usage is Asset Management.

Work in progress, provided as is.


TODO: Smarter way of distributing based on bounding box  
TODO: Add grid support (instead of one long line of assets)  
TODO: Figure out why i cannot spwan a TextRender actor UNLESS i have one already in scene (that seems like a bug of UE tho)
